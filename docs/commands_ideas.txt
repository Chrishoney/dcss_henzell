!scum -> Player has quit or escaped with less than five hundred points x times
    in y games (percent): truncated list of top scummed chars
!killsin -> duh
make !stats and !listgame take more options to search by, "full sql search" or something





 ---- done ----
!nstats -> opposite of !wstats; for non-won games
cat !won and !asc together using an option. !won -race duplicates the
output of !asc, and adds the functionality of !won -role.
